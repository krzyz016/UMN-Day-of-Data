Spatial data violate many of the assumptions of traditional statistical analysis.
Specifically, spatial data often exhibit:

* Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP)
* Spatial Autocorrelation

The datasets in these notebooks will both highlight how a failure to think spatially
can lead you to incorrect conclustions and also provide you with some tools to 
mitigate those errors.
